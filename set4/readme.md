TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
This week I have learnt how to open another file and getting out information needed out of that file. 
Some tips, when opening another file, need to use return{} to make sure it is closed afterwards.
This week's python exercise was pretty confusing, it was challenging to do. The def diarist(): one and the wordy pyramid take me a lot of time, but I got to the end.
